Guide on how coloring text works with the Animation Class:

There are custom escape characters mapped to each possible console color, here are a list of them and what type map too:

	"/0" = ConsoleColor.Black
	"/B" = ConsoleColor.DarkBlue
	"/G" = ConsoleColor.DarkGreen
	"/C" = ConsoleColor.DarkCyan
	"/R" = ConsoleColor.DarkRed
	"/M" = ConsoleColor.DarkMagenta
	"/Y" = ConsoleColor.DarkYellow
	"/A" = ConsoleColor.DarkGray
	"/b" = ConsoleColor.Blue
	"/g" = ConsoleColor.Green
	"/c" = ConsoleColor.Cyan
	"/r" = ConsoleColor.Red
	"/m" = ConsoleColor.Magenta
	"/y" = ConsoleColor.Yellow
	"/w" = ConsoleColor.White
	"/e" = ConsoleColor.Gray


The way you use them is you include them in your string and they are autoparsed by the Animation class. Here is an example:

	"Hello World! /rI am a demon/e!"

This produces "Hello World! " in grey text, "I am a demon" in red text, and "!" in grey text.
