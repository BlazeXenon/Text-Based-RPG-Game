This file holds all the mathematical formulas for scaling the game till level 50.


Max Experience = 2^(1.0/8.0 * Level) * 10

Enemy Health = RNG( LOWER BOUND: minimum_health + enemy_difficulty + 1 |||||| UPPER BOUND: minimum_health + (constant_increasing_health_interval * (enemy_difficulty + 1) );

Enemy Power = RNG( LOWER BOUND: minimum_power + enemy_difficulty + 1 |||||| UPPER BOUND: minimum_power + (minimum_power * (enemy_difficulty + 1)) )

Enemy Gold Yield RNG( LOWER BOUND: (current_health + current_power) * 5 ||||||| UPPER BOUND: (current_health + current_power) * 8 );

Attack Calculations = RNG ( power + RNG(-3, 3) )
